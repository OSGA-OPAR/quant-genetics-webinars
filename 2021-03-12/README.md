**Goals of this webinar:**
- Why should one use/learn R?
- How to install R/Rstudio
- Learn about R basics: variables, programming, functions
- Learn about the R package ecosystem that extends its capabilities
- See a basic statistical analysis example
- Learn about additional resources 


**Material for webinar**
- [Slides](intro_R.html) for talk (HTML format).
- [Source code](intro_R.Rmd) used to generate the slides(RMD format).
- [Resources](Resources.Rmd) links offering a variety of resources(MD format).
- [Script example](script_example.R) used to generate the script example (R format).
- [Basic statistical analysis example](intro-r.ipynb) notebook to generate the analysis example (ipynb format).
- [Script timeline](timeline.R) source code used to generate the timeline plot (R format).
- [Script flat violin plot](geom_flat_violin.R) source code used to generate the flat violin plot (R format) ([original source](https://gist.github.com/dgrtwo/eb7750e74997891d7c20#file-geom_flat_violin-r)).
