**Goals of this webinar:**
Heterogeneous stock (HS) rats are an outbred population that was created in 1984 by intercrossing 8 inbred strains. The Center for GWAS in Outbred Rats (http://www.ratgenes.org) has developed a suite of analysis tools for analyzing genome wide association studies (GWAS) in HS rats
* explain the HS rat population and their history
* describe the automated pipeline that performs GWAS in HS rats
* explore the fine mapping of associated regions and explain the various secondary analyses that we use to prioritize genes within associated intervals
