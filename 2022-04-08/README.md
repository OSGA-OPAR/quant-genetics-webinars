**Abstract**: The Mouse Phenome Database (MPD; https://phenome.jax.org ) is a widely used resource that provides access to primary experimental data, protocols and analysis tools for mouse phenotyping studies. Data are contributed by investigators around the world and represent a broad scope of phenotyping endpoints and disease-related characteristics in na√Øve mice and those exposed to drugs, environmental agents or other treatments. MPD is engineered to facilitate interactive data exploration and quantitative analysis. It encompasses data from inbred strains and other reproducible panels, including HMDP, KOMP, Collaborative Cross (CC), CC-RIX, and founder strains, along with primary data from mapping populations, including historic mapping crosses and advanced high-diversity mouse populations such as Diversity Outbred mice. A new Study Intake Platform (SIP) for data contributors allows domain experts to submit and annotate their own data with relevant ontology terms. Data contributors also provide detailed information for protocols and animal environmental conditions to fulfill ARRIVE guidelines. Data are exposed to analysis tools within MPD and are available through APIs to other systems. We will demonstrate selected MPD tools, including GenomeMUSter (a new imputed SNP grid on 500+ strains of mice, 83+M locations) and a GWAS metanalysis tool.
