### Notes from the live lecture and chat

You can try notebooks at: https://jupyter.org/try and https://colab.research.google.com.

An interactive power calculation app for BXD population by David Ashbrook using R/Shiny: http://power.genenetwork.org/.

If you want to use Jupyter notebooks with version control, you may want to use [Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) which will create versions that are human-readable and hence friendlier for version control systems.
