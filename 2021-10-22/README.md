**Goals of this webinar:**
* To describe the relationship between artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL).
* To describe general scenarios when ML is appropriate.
* To understand methods for comparing the performance of different ML algorithms 
* To layout general criteria to examine when evaluating literature that includes machine learning algorithms
