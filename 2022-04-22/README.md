**Abstract:** This presentation will guide attendees with how to access genomewide association study summary statistics, and showcase resources available for annotating these summary data for follow-up analyses, including gene-based analyses, eQTL and epigenetic annotation as well as causal variable analysis. We will guide attendees through components of a GWAS summary dataset and two excellent resources - FUMA and MASSIVE - that use these summary files as inputs to generate vast amounts of annotations that can be brought forward to answer translational research questions.
