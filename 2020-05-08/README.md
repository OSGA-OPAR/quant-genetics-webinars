[Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

To view the Jupyter notebooks, just click on the links.

To modify or interact with the notebooks, you will have to [download Jupyter and R, and set them to work together](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/jupyter-notebook-r).  That way you can tweak the analysis, or do a similar analysis with a different dataset.
