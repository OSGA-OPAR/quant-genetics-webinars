- [Question/Answer session](qa.md) Responses to questions submitted in the chat box during the webinar
- [Webinar slides](qtl-intro.ipynb) Jupyter notebook
- [Analysis of a rat F2 cross](solberg-rat-analysis.ipynb) Jupyter notebook showing the workflow of the analysis of a rat cross conducted by Solberg and colleagues; uses R and R/qtl to carry out the analysis

[Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

To view the Jupyter notebooks, just click on the links.

To modify or interact with the notebooks, you will have to [download Jupyter and R, and set them to work together](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/jupyter-notebook-r).  That way you can tweak the analysis, or do a similar analysis with a different dataset.
